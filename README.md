Human Following Luggage Carrying Robot
A mini-project developed as part of the Electronics and Communication Engineering curriculum at Velammal Engineering College (Autonomous).
This robot is designed to autonomously follow a human and carry luggage using sensors, motor drivers, and Arduino-based control logic.

## Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous robot capable of following a human operator while carrying luggage. The robot integrates ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, DC motors, and control algorithms to track human movement and avoid obstacles. A modular luggage-carrying mechanism enhances convenience, especially in crowded or travel-intensive environments.
